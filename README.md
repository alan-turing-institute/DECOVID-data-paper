# DECOVID Data Descriptor Paper

`## Add reference with DOI here`

## Introduction

The DECOVID dataset contains comprehensive electronic healthcare record (EHR) data collected from patients admitted to two large, digitally-mature teaching hospitals in the United Kingdom between 1st January 2020 and 28th February 2021,  with follow-up running until the 28th March 2021 and 13th April 2021, for the two hospitals respectively. The two hospital trusts involved were University Hospitals Birmingham and University College London Hosptials.

The development of the DECOVID database was motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of answering clinically important questions to support the COVID-19 response.

Raw data were extracted from local EHRs and transformed into the [Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Common Data Model version 5.3.1](https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/). This standardises the dataset making it more useable for data analysts and interoperable for researchers outside of the DECOVID project.

These data include longitudinal physiology, treatments, laboratory findings, diagnoses and outcomes.

There are  includes 165,420 patients across 256,804 hospital presentations; 16.7 million hours of clinical care; 3,752 deaths (both COVID-19- and non-COVID-19-related); 108 million measured clinical observations encompassing vital signs, acute physiology and laboratory findings; 2.64 million clinical diagnoses relating to both acute and chronic health conditions; and 15.19 million drug administration events.
