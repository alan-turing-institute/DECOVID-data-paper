# DECOVID data descriptor paper

## Introduction

The DECOVID dataset contains comprehensive electronic healthcare record (EHR) data collected from patients admitted to two large, digitally-mature teaching hospitals in the United Kingdom between 1st January 2020 and 28th February 2021,  with follow-up running until the 28th March 2021 and 13th April 2021, for the two hospitals respectively. The hospital trusts involved are University Hospitals Birmingham and University College London Hosptials. 

The development of the DECOVID database was motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of answering clinically important questions to support the COVID-19 response. 

Raw data were extracted from local EHRs and transformed into the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership-Common Data Model (add in link here or reference). This standardises the dataset making it more useable for data analysts and interoperable for researchers outside of the DECOVID project.

These data include longitudinal physiology, treatments, laboratory findings, diagnoses and outcomes. 

There are 158,733 distinct patients, 258,212 hospital visits, 17,780,705 hours of clinical care for patients with completed visits, 9,548 fatalities (both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 related), 115,740,643 measurements (e.g., labs, vitals, machine settings) and 16,248,577 drug exposures in the DECOVID dataset.
